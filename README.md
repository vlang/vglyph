# Text Render

A high-performance, feature-rich text rendering engine for the V programming language, built on top of **Pango**, **FreeType**, and **Sokol**.

This library provides production-grade text layout capabilities, including bidirectional text support (Arabic/Hebrew), complex script shaping, text wrapping, rich text markup, and sub-pixel accurate rendering, while maintaining a pure V-friendly API.

## Architecture

The system is designed to decouple **Text Layout** from **Text Rendering**. This separation allows for efficient hit-testing and layout calculations without needing an active graphics context, and batched rendering for high performance.

### Data Flow

    Input[Input String] --> Context

    LayoutEngine -->|Shape & Wrap| LayoutStruct[Layout Info]
    
    subgraph "Pure V Land"
    LayoutStruct --Contains--> Items[Runs & Glyphs]
    LayoutStruct --Contains--> CharRects[Hit Detection Rects]
    LayoutStruct --> HitTest[Hit Test API]
    end

    LayoutStruct --> Renderer

    Atlas --Batch Update--> GPU[Sokol Texture]
    Renderer -->|Draw Call| GPU
```

### Key Components

1.  **Context (`text_render.Context`)**: 
    - Manages the connection to Pango and FontConfig.
    - Responsible for the heavy lifting of text shaping, wrapping, and laying out.
    - Produces a `Layout` object.

2.  **Layout (`text_render.Layout`)**:
    - A lightweight, pure V struct containing all necessary information to draw text or perform hit tests.
    - Stores text as "Runs" (`Item`), which contain shaped "Glyphs".
    - Stores "Baked" Character Rectangles (`CharRect`) for O(1) or O(N) hit testing without querying Pango again.

3.  **Renderer (`text_render.Renderer`)**:
    - Manages the `GlyphAtlas` (dynamic texture packing) and Glyph Cache.
    - Renders `Layout` objects to the screen using Sokol `gg`.
    - Handles color tinting and texture coordinates.

4.  **Glyph Atlas**:
    - Dynamically packs grayscale bitmaps of glyphs into a single GPU texture.
    - Uses a "dirty" flag system to batch uploads, ensuring only one `sg_update_image` call per frame (sokol requirement).

## Technical Nuances & Discrepancies

### Logical vs. Ink Rectangles (Hit Testing vs. Rendering)
You may observe that certain characters (especially Emojis or script fonts with large swashes) render outside their hit-test rectangle.

*   **Logical Rectangle (Hit Test)**: This is the typographic "cell" determined by Pango. It ensures consistent line spacing and cursor placement. The `Layout.hit_test()` method uses these bounds.
*   **Ink Rectangle (Visual)**: This is the actual bounding box of the pixels drawn. FreeType respects the font's vertical bearings (`bitmap_top`), allowing glyphs to "bleed" out of their logical line height.

**This is intentional behavior.** It allows for tall emojis to appear native without forcing the entire line of text to have varying or excessive height, preserving the rhythm of the paragraph.

### Coordinate Systems
*   **Pango Units**: Internally, Pango uses integers scaled by 1024 (`PANGO_SCALE`). The `Layout` struct normalizes these to standard floating-point pixels (`f32`) for the user.
*   **RTL Text**: For Right-to-Left languages, Pango may return negative width extents to indicate directionality. The library automatically normalizes these into standard positive-width rectangles during the "baking" phase of the layout.

### Rendering Cycle
To satisfy Sokol's requirement of a single texture update per frame, the Renderer separates **Draw** calls from **Commit** calls.
1.  `draw_layout(...)`: Queues quads and loads new glyphs into the CPU-side atlas if needed.
2.  `commit()`: Must be called **once** at the end of the frame to upload any new glyph data to the GPU. Not calling this will result in invisible text for newly loaded characters.

## Usage

```v
// 1. Initialize
mut tr_ctx := text_render.new_context()!
mut renderer := text_render.new_renderer(mut gg_ctx)

// 2. Layout Text (Expensive - do this when text changes)
cfg := text_render.TextConfig{
    font_name: "Sans 20",
    width: 400,
    wrap: .pango_wrap_word
}
layout := tr_ctx.layout_text("Hello World", cfg)!

// 3. Render (Cheap - do this every frame)
renderer.draw_layout(layout, x, y)
renderer.commit()

// 4. Hit Test
index := layout.hit_test(mouse_x, mouse_y)
```
