# vglyph Feature Recommendations

This document outlines practical recommendations to bring `vglyph`'s rendering quality and feature
set in line with industry-standard text engines like CoreText (macOS), DirectWrite (Windows), and
modern web browsers.

## ~~1. Rendering Quality~~

The most immediate "feel" of a text engine comes from its rendering pipeline. `vglyph` currently
uses standard grayscale antialiasing.

### ~~1.1 LCD Subpixel Antialiasing~~
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Sharper text on non-Retina displays.

Standard engines use subpixel rendering (exploiting the R, G, B subpixels of LCD screens) to triple
horizontal resolution.
- **Status:** **Implemented (Hybrid Strategy)**
- **Details:**
    - High-DPI screens (>= 2.0x) use LCD Subpixel AA for maximum sharpness.
    - Low-DPI screens (< 2.0x) fallback to Grayscale AA with Gamma Correction to ensure solid
      weight.

### ~~1.2 Tunable Gamma Correction / Stem Darkening~~
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Matches system font weight perception.

macOS and Windows render fonts with different "weights" due to gamma correction. Standard engines
allow tuning this or default to a platform-specific value.
- **Status:** **Implemented**
- **Details:**
    - Added Gamma Correction (~1.45) to `glyph_atlas.v` for the Grayscale pipeline.
    - Resolves the "thin" look of raw FreeType rendering on standard displays.

### ~~1.3 Subpixel Positioning~~
**Priority:** Medium
**Impact:** Smoother animations and more precise kerning.

Professional engines position glyphs at fractional pixel coordinates (e.g., x=10.25).
- **Status:** **Implemented**
- **Details:**
    - Implemented horizontal subpixel positioning (1/4 pixel precision).
    - Uses oversampled glyphs (shifted outlines) cached in 4 bins.
    - `Renderer` automatically snaps to nearest bin for smooth motion.

## 2. Rich Text & Layout

Standard engines support "Attributed Strings"—single text buffers with multiple styles.

### ~~2.1 Attributed String API~~
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Essential for code editors, rich text documents, and complex UI.

- **Current State:** `draw_text(string, TextConfig)`. formatting applies to the entire string. Pango
  markup is supported via string parsing, but this is brittle for programmatic use.
- **Status: Implemented**
- **Recommendation:** Introduce a `RichText` struct.
    ```v
    struct RichText {
        runs []StyleRun // { text, style }
    }
    ```
    - Refactor `Context.layout_text` to accept this structure.
    - Allows programmatic toggling of bold/color ranges without string operations.

### ~~2.2 Block Styles~~
**Priority:** Medium
**Impact:** Required for document editors.

- **Current State:** `TextConfig` mixes character style (Font, Color) with block style
  (Align, Wrap).
- **Recommendation:** Split `TextConfig` into two distinct structures:
    - `TextStyle`: Character-level attributes (Font, Color, Size, Decorations).
    - `BlockStyle`: Layout attributes (Alignment, Wrap, Width, LineHeight, Indent).
    - `TextConfig` will compose these as distinct fields: `style` and `block`.

### 2.3 Inline Objects
**Priority:** Low
**Impact:** Chat apps (inline images), documents.

- **Current State:** Only text glyphs.
- **Recommendation:** Support `RunDelegate` or `Attachment` in the layout, reserving space
  (width/height) for custom rendering (images, UI controls) within the text flow.

## ~~3. Advanced Typography~~

### ~~3.1 OpenType Features API~~
**Priority:** Medium
**Impact:** Professional typography (Coding ligatures, Small Caps).

- **Current State: Implemented**
- **Recommendation:** Add a typed API for toggling features.
    ```v
    features: { 'liga': 1, 'smcp': 0 } // Typesafe feature control
    ```

### ~~3.2 Variable Fonts~~
**Priority:** Medium
**Impact:** Modern UI design flexibility.

- **Status: Implemented**
- **Details:**
    - Added `variation_axes` to `TextConfig` for explicit axis control.
    - Supports dynamic animation of `wght`, `wdth`, `slnt`, `opsz`, and other axes.

## 4. System Integration

### ~~4.1 Robust Font Fallback~~
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Multilingual support.

- **Current State: Implemented**
- **Recommendation:** Ensure `vglyph` can query the system (CoreText/DirectWrite) for the correct
  fallback font when a glyph is missing, rather than rendering "tofu" (boxes).

### 4.2 Accessibility Tree
**Priority:** Low (but Critical for commercial apps)
**Impact:** Screen reader support.

- **Recommendation:** Expose the logic structure (Lines, Paragraphs) to the OS accessibility API.
  (This is a large undertaking but standard for native-feeling apps).
